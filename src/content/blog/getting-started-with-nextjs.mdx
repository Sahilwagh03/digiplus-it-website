# Getting Started with Next.js 15: A Complete Guide

Next.js 15 brings exciting new features and improvements that make building modern web applications easier and more efficient than ever. In this comprehensive guide, we'll explore the key features and show you how to get started.

## What's New in Next.js 15?

Next.js 15 introduces several groundbreaking features:

- **Enhanced App Router**: Improved performance and developer experience
- **Server Components by Default**: Better performance and SEO
- **Turbopack Integration**: Faster development builds
- **Improved TypeScript Support**: Better type safety and developer experience

## Setting Up Your First Project

Getting started with Next.js 15 is straightforward:

```bash
npx create-next-app@latest my-app
cd my-app
npm run dev
```

The new project structure uses the App Router by default, which provides a more intuitive file-based routing system.

## Understanding the App Router

The App Router is the new routing system that uses React Server Components and provides:

- **File-based Routing**: Create routes by adding files to the `app` directory
- **Layouts**: Share UI between routes
- **Loading States**: Built-in loading UI
- **Error Boundaries**: Graceful error handling

## Server Components vs Client Components

Next.js 15 makes Server Components the default, which means:

- **Better Performance**: Components render on the server
- **Smaller Bundle Size**: Less JavaScript sent to the client
- **Better SEO**: Content is available for search engines

To use client-side features, you can opt into Client Components:

```tsx
'use client'

import { useState } from 'react'

export default function Counter() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0)
  return (
    <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>
      Count: {count}
    </button>
  )
}
```

## Best Practices

When building with Next.js 15, consider these best practices:

1. **Use Server Components by Default**: Only use Client Components when necessary
2. **Leverage Built-in Optimizations**: Use Next.js Image and Link components
3. **Implement Proper Metadata**: Use the new metadata API for SEO
4. **Optimize for Performance**: Use dynamic imports and code splitting

## Conclusion

Next.js 15 represents a significant step forward in the React ecosystem. With its focus on performance, developer experience, and modern web standards, it's the perfect choice for building scalable web applications.
